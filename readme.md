# Native Exports for .NET

Prototype for a .NET managed assembly to expose a native export.

This work is inspired by work in the [Xamarin][xamarin_embed_link], [CoreRT][corert_feature_link], and [DllExport][dllexport_link] projects.

## Requirements

### Minimum

* [.NET 5.0.0-preview.5.20278.1](https://github.com/dotnet/installer) or greater.
* [C99](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/history) compatible compiler.

### DNNE NuPkg Requirements

**Windows:**
* [Visual Studio 2015](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or greater.
* Windows 10 SDK - Installed with Visual Studio.
* 32 and 64 bit compilation supported.

**macOS:**
* [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) compiler on the path.
* 64 bit compilation supported.

**Linux:**
* [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) compiler on the path.
* 64 bit compilation supported.

## Exporting details

- The exported function must be marked `static` and `public`.

- The type exporting the function cannot be a nested type.

- Mark functions to export with [`UnmanagedCallersOnlyAttribute`][unmanagedcallersonly_link].

    ```CSharp
    public class Exports
    {
        [UnmanagedCallersOnlyAttribute(EntryPoint = "FancyName")]
        public static int MyExport(int a)
        {
            return a;
        }
    }
    ```

## Native API

The native API is defined in [`src/platform/dnne.h`](./src/platform/dnne.h).

The `DNNE_ASSEMBLY_NAME` must be set during compilation to indicate the name of the managed assembly to load. The assembly name should not include the extension. For example, if the managed assembly on disk is called `ClassLib.dll`, the expected assembly name is `ClassLib`.

The generated source will need to be linked against the [`nethost`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tutorials/netcore-hosting#create-a-host-using-nethosth-and-hostfxrh) library as either a static lib (`libnethost.[lib|a]`) or dynamic/shared library (`nethost.lib`). If the latter linking is performed, the `nethost.[dll|so|dylib]` will need to be deployed with the export binary or be on the path at run time.

The `set_failure_callback()` function can be used prior to calling an export to set a callback in the event runtime load or export discovery fails.

Failure to load the runtime or find an export results in the native library calling [`abort()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/program/abort).

The `preload_runtime()` function can be used to preload the runtime. This may be desirable prior to calling an export to avoid the cost of loading the runtime during the first export dispatch.

## Exporting a managed function

1) Adorn the desired managed function with `UnmanagedCallersOnlyAttribute`.
    - Optionally set the `EntryPoint` property to indicate the name of the native export. This property is available on both of the attributes.
    - If the `EntryPoint` property is `null`, the name of the mananged function is used. This default name will not include the namespace or class containing the function.
    - User supplied values in `EntryPoint` will not be modified or validated in any manner. This string will be consume by a C compiler and should therefore adhere to the [C language's restrictions on function names](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/functions).

1) Set the `<EnableDynamicLoading>true</EnableDynamicLoading>` property in the managed project containing the methods to export. This will produce a `*.runtimeconfig.json` that is needed to activate the runtime during export dispatch.

## Generating a native binary using the DNNE NuPkg

1) The DNNE NuPkg is published on [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DNNE), but can also be built locally.

    * Building the DNNE NuPkg locally is done by running `pack` on [`dnne-gen.csproj`](./src/dnne-gen/dnne-gen.csproj).

        `> dotnet pack dnne-gen.csproj`

1) Add the NuPkg to the target managed project.

    * If NuPkg was built locally, remember to update the projects `nuget.config` to point at the local location of the recently built DNNE NuPkg.

    ```xml
    <ItemGroup>
      <PackageReference Include="DNNE" Version="1.*" />
    </ItemGroup>
    ```

1) Build the managed project to generate the native binary. The native binary will have a `NE` suffix and the system extension for dynamic/shared native libraries (i.e. `.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`).

1) Deploy the native binary, managed assembly and associated `*.json` files for consumption from a native process.

### Generate manually

1) Run the [dnne-gen](./src/dnne-gen) tool on the managed assembly.

1) Take the generated source from `dnne-gen` and the DNNE [platform](./src/platform) source to compile a native binary with the desired native exports. See the [Native API](#nativeapi) section for build details.

1) Deploy the native binary, managed assembly and associated `*.json` files for consumption from a native process.

### Experimental attribute

There are scenarios where updating `UnmanagedCallersOnlyAttribute` may take time. In order to enable independent development and experimentation, the `DNNE.ExportAttribute` is also respected. This type can be modified to suit one's needs and `dnne-gen` updated to respect those changes at code gen time. The user should define the following in their assembly. They can then modify the attribute and `dnne-gen` as needed.

``` CSharp
namespace DNNE
{
    internal class ExportAttribute : Attribute
    {
        public ExportAttribute() { }
        public string EntryPoint { get; set; }
    }
}
```
    
The calling convention of the export will be the default for the .NET runtime on that platform. See the description of [`CallingConvention.Winapi`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.callingconvention).

Using `DNNE.ExportAttribute` to export a method requires a `Delegate` of the appropriate type and name to be at the same scope as the export. The naming convention is `<METHODNAME>Delegate`. For example:

```CSharp
public class Exports
{
    public delegate int MyExportDelegate(int a);

    [DNNE.Export(EntryPoint = "FancyName")]
    public static int MyExport(int a)
    {
        return a;
    }
}
```
